And what's more, I'm still leaning in a university, I don't have too much time in hacking my loving projects, so they might be updated slowly.

In another way think, my major is about `Electrical`, my coding skill doesn't as well as the `Computer Science`.I love CS, but my `The college entrance exam score` say "NO,YOU DON'T LOVE IT", so I get into the `Electrical Engineering`. 

BUT, WHAT A GOOD MAJOR IT IS!
