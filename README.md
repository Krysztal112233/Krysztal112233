# Skills

In general, my skills are all distributed in embedded systems and back-end programming.

Anyway, I like these two aspects, but I'm better at writing programs than drawing PCBs.Although PCB drawing is my profession.

In future plans, I intend to learn about embedded ports of Linux and compilers.

## Programming Language

- âœ… Rust
- âœ… Golang
- âœ… Java/Kotlin
- âœ… C/C++
- âœ… TypeScript/JavaScript
- âœ… PHP(In the past)

## Embedded

- âœ… ESP32-[C3 ,S2 ,S3]
- âœ… K210 (Still learning)

## Stacks

- âœ… Paper/Spigot/Bukkit plugin
- âœ… Vue3
- âœ… Fabric Mods
- âœ… rocket.rs
- âœ… Iris Go
- âœ… ESP-IDF (or ESP-IDF RS)

In the recent past, we have often studied how to write programs for embedded systems using the Rust language. Out of interest, I like to open Minecraft service to play with friends.
